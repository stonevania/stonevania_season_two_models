###### NEW PROCESS ######
# We are going to start using a github action to run the compression and generate
# the hash, and then push the newly generated files to a new public repo, so we
# will need to architect this a little differently. A rough outline of the new
# process is as follows:
# 1. Generate dated release as we do now
# 2. Copy generated release to releases/final/release.zip
# 3. Generate SHA1 checksum on release.zip
# 4. Write SHA1 checksum to releases/final/hash.txt
# 5. Copy current README to releases/final/
# 6. Push contents of releases/final/ to new, public repo

### Generate dated release ###
CURRENT_DATE=$(date "+%Y-%m-%d")
ZIPFILE="releases/$CURRENT_DATE.zip"

echo "Compressing current pack..."
zip -r $ZIPFILE assets/ pack.mcmeta pack.png README.md

### Copy dated release to releases/final/release.zip ###
FINAL_RELEASE_DIR="releases/final"
FINAL_RELEASE_ZIP="$FINAL_RELEASE_DIR/release.zip"
FINAL_RELEASE_SHA="$FINAL_RELEASE_DIR/hash.txt"

# Delete existing file, if present
for file in "$FINAL_RELEASE_DIR"/*; do
    if [ -f "$file" ] && [[ "$file" == *"release.zip"* ]]; then
        echo "Deleting existing release..."
        rm "$file"
    fi
done

# Copy file
echo "Creating new release..."
cp "$ZIPFILE" "$FINAL_RELEASE_ZIP"

### Generate SHA1 checksum ###
echo "Generating SHA1 checksum..."
CHECKSUM=$(sha1sum $FINAL_RELEASE_ZIP | awk '{print $1}')

# Create file if needed
if ! [ -f "$FINAL_RELEASE_SHA" ]; then
    echo "hash.txt does not exist, creating..."
    touch "$FINAL_RELEASE_SHA"
fi

### Write SHA1 checksum to file ###
echo "Writing SHA1 checksum to file..."
echo "$CHECKSUM" > "$FINAL_RELEASE_SHA"

printf "\e[1;31mThe latest release has been generated at $ZIPFILE.\e[0m\n"
printf "\e[1;31mA final release has been generated at $FINAL_RELEASE_ZIP.\e[0m\n"
printf "\e[1;31mThe SHA1 checksum for the final release has been saved to $FINAL_RELEASE_SHA.\e[0m\n"
printf "\e[1;31mFor posterity, the generated checksum is $CHECKSUM.\e[0m\n"

### Copy README to releases/final
echo "Copying README.md to release..."
CURRENT_README="./README.md"
RELEASE_README="$FINAL_RELEASE_DIR/README.md"

# Delete existing file, if present
for file in "$RELEASE_README"/*; do
    if [ -f "$file" ] && [[ "$file" == *"README.md"* ]]; then
        echo "Deleting existing README.md..."
        rm "$file"
    fi
done

# Copy file
cp "$CURRENT_README" "$RELEASE_README"

### Push generated release to new repo ###
echo "Pushing new release to release repo..."
GIT="git --git-dir=releases/final"

# Prepare git for push
$GIT add release.zip
$GIT add hash.txt
$GIT add README.md

# Configure git
$GIT config --global user.name "dadmannwalking"
$GIT config --global user.email "dadmannwalkingyt@gmail.com"

# Push new release
$GIT commit -m "new release"
$GIT push -u origin main
